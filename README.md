# Eat Your Nuts Webshop

It is a little webshop I build with HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, NodeJS and hbs (Handlebars). Users can add products to the shopping cart.

## Motivation

I made this website because I wanted learn more about NodeJS and Bootstrap. I also wanted to use my JavaScript skills.

## Where can I find the website?

The project has been deployed on Heroku and can be viewed here: https://eatyournuts.herokuapp.com/.
